### What is vQmod?

vQmod™ (aka Virtual Quick Mod) is an override system designed to avoid having to change core files. Instead of making changes to the core files directly, the changes are created as xml search/replace script files. The original source file is never altered. This results in a "virtual" change to the core during execution without any actual modification to the core files. Visit the [vQmod™](https://github.com/vqmod/vqmod) official repository.

## Installation

1) Download.

2) Install vQmod plugin uploading the osclass-vqmod-vX.X.zip file in your Osclass.

3) Go to the 'Manage mods' tab and click in 'Enable' button. It's all!

## Usage

1) Click in 'Manage mods' tab, then clic in 'Add mod file'.

2) Select and upload a zip file that contains the mod's xml file.

3) Enable the xml file.

## vQmod scripts Wiki

* IMPORTANT - To make mods aimed at specifically modifying another Osclass plugin, it is recommended that the name of the xml file SHOULD BE THE SAME NAME AS THE FOLDER of the target plugin. If you uninstall the target plugin, the mod xml will automatically be disabled, and the cache will be purged as well.
