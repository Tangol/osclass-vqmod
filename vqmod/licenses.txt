"vQmod"(TM) (aka Virtual Quick Mod) is a new innovation in php modification override methods.
Instead of modifying actual files to add custom modifications, source files are parsed
"on-the-fly" before the php include() or require() is called.
The source is cloned to a temp file and modifications are made to that temp file, then
substituted for the real file in the include path.
